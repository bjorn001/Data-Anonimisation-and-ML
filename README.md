This repository contains the Python code for applying different _k_-anonymisation algorithms, i.e., Optimal Lattice Anonymization (OLA), Mondrian, Top-Down Greedy Anonymisation (TDG), k-NN Clustering-Based (CB) Anonymisation,  on datasets and measuring their effects on Machine Learning (ML) Classifiers and Regression.

The respository is structured as follows:
1. Classification codebase
2. Regression codebase
3. Statistical testing code


How to run?
In order to install the necessary requirements either use `pipenv install` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
Then activate the virtual environment, e.g. with `pipenv shell`. This can also be done without the environment, but depends on dependencies.

After installing, navigate to the folder ...\k-AnonML-main using cd in command prompt. After this, you call the several arguments below to initiate the code, depending on what privacy method and model combination you want to use. Each model uses a different command, such as 'log' for logistic regression. 

The parameters, i.e., dataset, ML algorithm, _k_-anonymisation algorithm, and _k_ are defined via arguments as follows:

```txt
usage: baseline_with_repetitions.py [-h] [--start-k START_K] [--stop-k STOP_K] [--step-k STEP_K] [--debug] [--verbose] [{cmc,mgm,adult,cahousing}] [{rf,knn,svm,xgb}] {mondrian,ola,tdg,cb} ...

Anonymize data utilising different privacy methods and analyse the effects of the anonymization on the classification and regression performance

positional arguments:
  {cahousing}
                        the dataset used for anonymization
  {log,nb, ada, lin,log,lasso,rf,knn,svm,xgb}      machine learning classifier
  {mondrian,ola,tdg,cb}
    mondrian            mondrian anonyization algorithm
    ola                 ola anonyization algorithm
    tdg                 tdg anonyization algorithm
    cb                  cb anonyization algorithm

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --start-k START_K     initial value for k of k-anonymity
  --stop-k STOP_K       last value for k of k-anonymity
  --step-k STEP_K       step for increasing k of k-anonymity
  --debug, -d           enable debugging
  --verbose, -v
```
